                <p>The celebration of Eid-ul-Adha is to commemorate Prophet Ibrahim's <br> devotion to Allah SWT and his readiness to sacrifice his son, Ismail. <br> At the very point of sacrifice, Allah SWT replaced Ismail with a ram, <br> which was to be slaughtered in place of his son. This command from <br> Allah SWT was a test of Prophet Ibrahim's willingness and commitment <br> to obey his Lord's command, without question. Therefore, Eid-ul-Adha <br> means the festival of sacrifice.</p>
